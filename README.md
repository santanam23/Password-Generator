# Password Generator Starter Code
I was debating on creating a const and let on this assignmnet to make it more unique but i changed it so many times back and for. I decided to restart and keep it simple. 

I sticked to var and made the Javascript code smaller. 

I started with HTML because I felt there were too many div's and wanted to make them more simple. I added input and was debating on creating a table and a check list under the passsword prompt. I decided against it and just went along to what i had commited.

Then I went to CSS and revised it to give it more color. I did not us media @ because I didn't need it with such small content.

I began Javascript and stuck to Var and just added the symbols and numbers and letters. Next time I will come back after the bootcamp and use Array and shuffle array.

 Lastly, I created an alert to appear on the screen to let people know of my awesome simple password generator.
